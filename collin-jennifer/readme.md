<!--Initialize the project with npm init, which creates package.json and package-lock.json files. Don't forget to add node_modules to your .gitignore file!

As a developer, I want to use the ExpressJS framework to set up a server file to handle HTTP requests and deliver responses.

As a user, I want to access the form directly so I can easily add new articles.
As a user, I want feedback if I have made an error so that I can make sure to always access the correct URL. -->
